description="""King Kong is a fictional monster, resembling an enormous gorilla, 
that has appeared in various media since 1933. He has been dubbed The Eighth Wonder 
of the World, a phrase commonly used within the films. His first appearance was in 
the novelization of the 1933 film King Kong from RKO Pictures, with the film 
premiering a little over two months later. Upon its initial release and subsequent 
re-releases, the film received universal acclaim. A sequel quickly followed that 
same year with The Son of Kong, featuring Little Kong. Toho produced King Kong vs. 
Godzilla (1962) featuring a giant Kong battling Toho's Godzilla and King Kong Escapes 
(1967), a series loosely based on Rankin/Bass' The King Kong Show (1966-1969). In 1976,
 Dino De Laurentiis produced a modern remake of the original film directed by John Guillermin.
  A sequel, King Kong Lives, followed a decade later featuring a Lady Kong. Another remake of 
  the original, this time set in 1933, was released in 2005 from filmmaker Peter Jackson.""",
